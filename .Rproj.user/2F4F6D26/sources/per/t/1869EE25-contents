I study agency problems of developing country governance at [UChicago Harris](https://harris.uchicago.edu). In particular, I use examples from natural resources and the environment to examine how administrative and organizational structures of developing country governments affects bureaucratic corruption and, secondly, how political and economic developments give rise to state capacity at large. I hold a B.A. in Ethics, Politics and Economics from Yale University and have previously worked at [Stanford FSE](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu), [UN ESCAP](https://www.unescap.org/our-work/macroeconomic-policy-financing-development), and [J-PAL Southeast Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/southeast-asia).
