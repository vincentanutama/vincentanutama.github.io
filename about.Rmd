I study agency problems of developing country governance at [UChicago Harris](https://harris.uchicago.edu). In particular, I examine how organizational structures of developing country governments affect the market structure of corruption. More broadly, I am interested in the determinants of bureaucratic state capacity. I hold a B.A. in Ethics, Politics and Economics from Yale University and have previously worked at [Stanford FSE](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu), [UN ESCAP](https://www.unescap.org/our-work/macroeconomic-policy-financing-development), and [J-PAL Southeast Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/southeast-asia).
