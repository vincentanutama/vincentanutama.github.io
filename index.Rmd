I am a PhD student in Public Policy at [The University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu). 

  &nbsp;
<!---
I use insights from organizational economics, political economy, and public finance to examine the consequences of administrative, political, and fiscal decentralization for corruption and bureaucratic efficiency.

I study the roles of social and economic organizations in the governance of developing countries. My research draws from organizational economics and political economy. Specific areas of focus include bureaucracies, decentralization, and corruption in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
