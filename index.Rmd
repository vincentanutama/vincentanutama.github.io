I am a PhD student in Public Policy at [University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu). 

  &nbsp;

My research fields are organizational and development economics, focusing on the agency problems of developing country governments. I study how their organizational and institutional structures affect the market for corruption. I am also interested in the political economic determinants of bureaucratic state capacity and the centralization of authority.
