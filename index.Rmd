### Vincent Tanutama

  &nbsp;

I am a PhD student in Public Policy at [University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu). 

  &nbsp;

I study governments in developing countries. I use insights from organizational economics, political economy, and public finance to study aspects of administrative, political, and fiscal decentralization and their consequences for corruption and bureaucratic efficiency. I am also interested in the political economic determinants of administrative state capacity and the centralization of authority.
