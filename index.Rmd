I am a PhD student in Public Policy at [The University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu). 

  &nbsp;
<!---
I use insights from organizational economics, political economy, and public finance to examine the consequences of administrative, political, and fiscal decentralization for corruption and bureaucratic efficiency.

I study governance in developing countries. My research draws insights from political economy of development, organizational economics, and political sociology to examine the roles of social and economic organizations for the governance structure of, and thus the capacity of, the state. Specific areas of focus include bureaucracies, decentralization and corruption in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
