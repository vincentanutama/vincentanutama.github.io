I am a PhD student in Public Policy at [The University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu). 

  &nbsp;

I study governments in developing countries. I use insights from organizational economics, political economy, and public finance to examine the consequences of administrative, political, and fiscal decentralization for corruption and bureaucratic efficiency. I am ultimately interested in the roles of social and economic organization for the governance structure of, and thus the capacity of, the state.
